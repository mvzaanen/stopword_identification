# This script takes a text file as input.  It assumes that the text
# file is already tokenized by separating each token using whitespace.
# The script then puts each word on a separate line and converts it to
# lowercase.  It also removes empty lines.  It also only takes lines
# with letters.  This also works for letters with diacritics.
